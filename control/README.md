Raspberry Pi - Programmable Logic Controller

Alright, so now its time to dig in to what I want to do with this project!

Basically, my ultimate goal is to affordably create standalone controllers for each area/room of my house.  
Doing this will allow me to have observational data for each location at a higher temporal resolution 
(airport sites typically only report a few times per hour at most; I would like to have 1-minute observations).  
Furthermore, by developing a low-cost and scalable system the station could be more easily adopted to evolve into 
any home automation project I need. 

The following lists some of the areas that I would like to target:(in order of importance):

Garden
Measure : Temperature
Measure : Barometric Pressure
Measure : Humidity
Measure : Wind Speed
Measure : Wind Direction
Measure : Lightning
Photography (webcam or still-shots)
Control : Water Pump
Control : Sprinklers
Control : Gate
Control : Miscellaneous

Garage
Measure : Temperature
Control : Lightning
Control : Garage Door
Control : Miscellaneous

Lounge
Measure : Temperature
Control : Lightning
Control : Miscellaneous

Kitchen
Measure : Temperature
Control : Lightning
Control : Miscellaneous

Bedrooms
Measure : Temperature
Control : Lightning
Control : Miscellaneous

There are a few other considerations that I will try to work into my station:
Battery power
Solar power
Real-time clock
Portability
Long-term data logging
Data relay via internet (Considering OpenHAB)
Build an attractive housing for each room (taking the environment into consideration i.e. Waterproof etc.)
